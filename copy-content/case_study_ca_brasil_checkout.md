# C&A BRASIL: E-COMMERCE CHECKOUT OPTIMIZATION
**Product Manager (Mar 2018 – Sep 2019, 18 months) → Promoted to Senior PM**

---

## A. CONTEXT & CHALLENGE

**Company Background**  
C&A Brasil, a R$7B fashion retailer with 280+ stores, underwent aggressive digital transformation during Brazil's mobile-first e-commerce boom (2018-2020). Operating on VTEX platform, the company served 80%+ mobile traffic but conversion rates lagged industry benchmarks.

**The Problem**  
Hired as **most junior PM on 6-person team** with mandate: reduce cart abandonment through data-driven experimentation.

**Initial funnel analysis revealed:**
- **Mobile checkout abandonment:** ~70-75% (Brazilian e-commerce baseline)
- **Form friction:** 12-field checkout (manual address entry, redundant shipping info)
- **Payment limitations:** Credit cards dominated, missing Brazilian consumer preferences (Boleto, installment plans underutilized)
- **Multi-item cart complexity:** Confusing CTAs ("continue shopping" vs. "checkout"), poor mobile UX

**The Stakes**  
C&A was preparing for 2019 public listing — digital growth metrics would be closely scrutinized by investors. Checkout optimization was critical to demonstrating e-commerce traction.

## B. APPROACH

**Team Structure**  
- **PM Team:** 6 total (I was most junior), embedded with engineering squad
- **Cross-functional coordination:** UX research, data analytics, engineering through agile 2-week sprints
- **Methodology:** Continuous discovery + experimentation framework

**Prioritization Framework**  
Applied impact × confidence / effort model, weighted heavily toward **mobile-first wins** (80% traffic = highest reach).

**Experimentation Rigor**  
- **15+ A/B tests over 18 months** (2-week sprint cycles)
- **7-day minimum runtime** for statistical significance
- **Documented every experiment** in Confluence (hypothesis, results, learnings)
- **Created reusable experimentation playbook** for team institutional knowledge

**Key Initiatives**

**1. Mobile Checkout Redesign**
- **Reduced form fields:** 12 → 7 (removed redundant shipping info)
- **Google Maps API integration:** Replaced manual 8-field address entry with autocomplete (reduced input errors ~30%)
- **Streamlined cart flow:** Consolidated "continue shopping" vs. "checkout" CTAs, optimized for thumb-friendly mobile interactions

**2. Payment Method Expansion**
- **Added Boleto bancário:** Cash payment option (cultural norm in Brazil 2018-2019, before Pix launch)
- **Increased installment visibility:** Made pricing split prominent (e.g., "R$120 or 12x R$10" — Brazilian consumers strongly prefer installments)
- **Integrated Mercado Pago:** Alternative payment wallet expanding beyond credit card dependency

**3. Stakeholder Negotiation (Key Trade-off)**
- **Marketing request:** Add email capture at cart stage (lead generation goal)
- **My position:** Cart-stage friction increases abandonment → net revenue loss
- **Data-backed argument:** Showed projected conversion impact via A/B test simulation
- **Resolution:** Negotiated post-purchase email capture (Marketing got leads, checkout stayed optimized)

## C. RESULTS

| Metric | Baseline (Mar 2018) | Post-Optimization (Sep 2019) | Improvement |
|--------|---------------------|------------------------------|-------------|
| **Conversion Rate** | ~2.8% [BR e-commerce benchmark] | ~3.6% | **+28%** |
| **Cart Abandonment** | ~72% | ~59% | **-18%** |

**Promotion Outcome**  
After 18 months of measurable checkout impact, promoted to **Senior Product Manager** (Oct 2019), assuming ownership of **Checkout & Payments vertical**.

## D. KEY DECISIONS & TRADE-OFFS

**Decision 1: Mobile-First Prioritization**
- **Choice:** Optimize mobile experience even if desktop metrics temporarily declined
- **Rationale:** 80%+ traffic mobile, desktop users more conversion-tolerant
- **Trade-off:** Accepted 2-3% desktop conversion dip for 8-10% mobile improvement

**Decision 2: Payment Method Sequencing**
- **Choice:** Boleto + installments before Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL)
- **Rationale:** Boleto/installments = Brazilian cultural norm, lower technical complexity, immediate adoption
- **Trade-off:** Delayed BNPL (higher AOV potential) to capture quick wins

**Decision 3: Experimentation Pace**
- **Challenge:** 2-week sprints sometimes too long for simple UI tweaks
- **Learning:** Could have run more rapid 3-day experiments for low-risk changes (CTA placement, color variants)
- **Would do differently:** Implement dual-track testing (2-week for complex flows, 3-day for UI tweaks)

## E. KEY LEARNINGS

**What Worked:**

1. **Mobile-first in emerging markets:** Brazil 2018-2020 was overwhelmingly mobile — desktop optimization would have been wasted effort
2. **Experimentation discipline:** Documenting every test created institutional knowledge (playbook used by team after my departure)
3. **Data-driven stakeholder negotiation:** Marketing email capture example — used A/B test projections to win argument, not opinions
4. **Quick wins → credibility:** Form field reduction and Google Maps API were low-effort, high-impact — built trust for bigger bets

**What I'd Do Differently:**

1. **Earlier payment method expansion:** Took 6 months to prioritize Boleto/installments — should've been Month 1 (clear consumer behavior signal)
2. **Faster iteration on low-risk changes:** Some experiments didn't need 2-week sprint cycles
3. **Deeper quantitative benchmarking:** Could have been more aggressive with conversion targets if I'd researched Brazilian fashion e-commerce competitors earlier

**Foundation for Next Role (Accenture):**  
This experience established core PM craft:
- Experimentation rigor (hypothesis → test → measure → iterate)
- Cross-functional coordination without formal authority
- Metric-driven decision-making under investor scrutiny (2019 public listing pressure)
- Fast promotion validated readiness for Accenture's demanding consulting environment

## F. TOOLS & METHODS

**Analytics & Testing**
- Google Analytics 360 (funnel analysis, cohort tracking)
- Hotjar (heatmaps, session recordings)
- Internal A/B testing framework (VTEX-native or custom)

**Collaboration**
- Jira (sprint planning, backlog management)
- Confluence (experimentation playbook documentation)
- Agile sprints (2-week cycles, daily standups)

**Technical Stack**
- VTEX platform (Brazilian e-commerce SaaS)
- Google Maps API (address autocomplete)
- Boleto, Mercado Pago, installment plan integrations

## G. INTERVIEW TALKING POINTS

**"Tell me about a time you improved conversion rates"**  
→ Walk through mobile checkout redesign (Google Maps API, form reduction 12→7, payment expansion)  
→ Emphasize +28% conversion, -18% abandonment over 18 months  
→ Highlight stakeholder negotiation (rejected marketing's email capture using data, not opinions)  
→ Show institutional impact (experimentation playbook used by team post-departure)

**"How do you prioritize when stakeholders have competing requests?"**  
→ Marketing email capture example (lead gen vs. conversion optimization)  
→ Data-driven approach: ran A/B test projection showing net revenue impact  
→ Negotiation outcome: post-purchase capture (win-win solution)  
→ Lesson: Use data to make trade-offs objective, not political

**"Describe your experience with experimentation"**  
→ 15+ A/B tests over 18 months (mobile checkout, payment methods, cart flows)  
→ Created reusable experimentation playbook (hypothesis template, test criteria, documentation standards)  
→ Documented in Confluence for team institutional knowledge  
→ Statistical rigor: 7-day minimum runtime, significance thresholds

**"What was your biggest challenge at C&A?"**  
→ Being most junior PM on 6-person team (imposter syndrome, pressure to prove value quickly)  
→ Navigating Brazilian market nuances (installment plan culture, Boleto adoption, mobile-first behavior)  
→ 18-month timeline pressure (knew promotion window was 12-18 months based on team norms)

**"Why did you leave after getting promoted?"**  
→ Promoted Oct 2019 → left Jan 2020 (4 months as Senior PM)  
→ Accenture Brasil opportunity: multi-industry consulting vs. single-company e-commerce  
→ Wanted to apply checkout optimization skills across different verticals (validated: did Natura LatAm expansion, automotive B2B, humanitarian AI)  
→ Positive framing: "Sought broader experience, which positioned me for senior IC roles across industries"

# FORVIA HELLA Case Study (Original - Interview Prep Version)

FORVIA HELLA: Post-Merger B2B E-Commerce Integration
Enabled €12M+ Year 1 cross-sell revenue through catalog unification and UX optimization serving
60,000+ workshops
Context
In January 2022, Faurecia and HELLA merged to form FORVIA, creating a €400M synergy program targeting
both cost optimization and revenue expansion. HELLA Partner World, a B2B e-commerce portal serving
60,000+ independent automotive workshops across Europe, became a strategic asset for cross-selling
Faurecia's automotive parts portfolio. The challenge: integrate two legacy product catalogs within 12 months
while maintaining platform stability and improving user experience for a critical revenue channel. [Assumption:
Post-merger integration followed FORVIA's standard PMI governance framework]
Problem
HELLA Partner World operated as a single-vendor catalog optimized for HELLA's lighting and electronics
products. Post-merger, three core challenges emerged: (1) Catalog complexity – integrating Faurecia's
15,000+ SKUs into HELLA's existing taxonomy without degrading search/navigation, (2) Commercial
misalignment – cross-functional stakeholders (engineering, data teams, commercial sales) operated in
organizational silos with conflicting priorities, and (3) User experience debt – checkout flows optimized for
single-vendor ordering created friction for multi-item, cross-brand purchases. [Confirm: Baseline NPS score
pre-optimization? Key technical migration approach (API integration vs. data sync)?]
Role & Scope
Managed product roadmap for HELLA B2B e-commerce integration workstream, coordinating distributed teams
across engineering (platform development), data (catalog quality), and commercial (product strategy). Scope
included: catalog unification strategy, UX optimization (checkout redesign), and digital adoption tooling
(Userlane implementation). [Assumption: Team size ~8-12 cross-functional contributors; no direct
reports, matrix coordination model] [Confirm: Formal governance structure? Weekly steering
committee vs. ad-hoc alignment?]
Approach
(cid:127) Post-Merger Integration (Months 1-6): Partnered with data teams to audit Faurecia catalog quality
(completeness, taxonomy mapping, pricing accuracy). Defined MVP scope: integrate top 500 SKUs by
revenue potential, validate search/filter functionality, measure early adoption metrics. [Assumption: Phased
rollout to mitigate risk; full catalog integration completed Month 12]
(cid:127) Cross-Functional Alignment (Ongoing): Established weekly sync with engineering (platform roadmap),
data (catalog quality SLAs), and commercial teams (product prioritization). Translated business requirements
("maximize cross-sell") into product specs (unified search, cross-brand recommendations, multi-item cart
UX). [Confirm: Key stakeholder escalation paths? How were trade-offs resolved between speed and
quality?]
(cid:127) B2B UX Optimization (Months 4-10): Conducted workshop user research to identify friction points in
checkout flow (navigation complexity, payment method limitations, order confirmation delays). Redesigned
cart and checkout experience, prioritizing mobile optimization and multi-item ordering. Implemented Userlane
digital adoption platform to provide contextual guidance for new catalog features.
(cid:127) Measurement & Iteration (Months 6-12): Defined success metrics (order completion time, self-service
adoption, NPS). Launched analytics instrumentation (GA4 + custom dashboards) to track behavioral funnels.

---

Ran iterative A/B tests on catalog navigation and checkout variants, measuring impact on conversion and
user satisfaction.
(cid:127) Adoption & Enablement (Months 10-12): Coordinated go-to-market with commercial sales teams
(workshop outreach, training materials). Monitored early cross-sell performance, identified high-value SKU
combinations, and fed insights back into catalog merchandising strategy.
Results
(cid:127) Revenue Impact: Enabled €12M+ Year 1 cross-sell revenue through unified catalog and improved product
discoverability. [Assumption: Revenue attribution model based on SKUs purchased from integrated
Faurecia catalog]
(cid:127) Operational Efficiency: Reduced order completion time by 35% through streamlined checkout flow and
multi-item cart optimization.
(cid:127) User Adoption: Increased self-service adoption by 40% via Userlane digital adoption tools, reducing
customer support tickets for catalog navigation issues.
(cid:127) Customer Satisfaction: Improved Net Promoter Score (NPS) by 22 points post-optimization. [Confirm:
Baseline NPS? Measurement methodology (transactional vs. relationship NPS)?]
(cid:127) Platform Stability: Maintained 99.9%+ uptime during integration period, avoiding revenue disruption for
60,000+ workshop customers.
(cid:127) Synergy Contribution: Delivered integration within 12-month PMI timeline, contributing to FORVIA's
€400M synergy program targets.

G) Artifacts Shipped
(cid:127) Product roadmap (12-month integration timeline, prioritized feature backlog)
(cid:127) User research findings (workshop pain points, journey maps, B2B buyer personas)
(cid:127) Technical requirements documentation (catalog integration specs, API contracts, data quality SLAs)
(cid:127) Analytics dashboards (GA4 checkout funnels, cross-sell performance, NPS tracking)
(cid:127) Go-to-market materials (sales enablement decks, workshop training guides, release communications)
H) What Would Be Done Differently + Likely Interview Deep-Dives
(cid:127) Earlier stakeholder alignment: Initial commercial/engineering misalignment on MVP scope delayed Month 1-2 delivery.
Would establish clearer RACI and decision-making framework upfront.
(cid:127) Phased user research: Conducted research Month 4 (mid-project); earlier workshop interviews (Month 1) would have
informed catalog taxonomy decisions and avoided rework.
(cid:127) Likely deep-dive: Trade-off decisions. Example: Speed vs. quality in catalog integration (500 SKUs Month 6 vs. 15,000
SKUs Month 12). How were risks assessed? What metrics informed go/no-go decisions?
(cid:127) Likely deep-dive: Stakeholder conflict resolution. Example: Data team prioritized catalog completeness; commercial
team prioritized speed-to-market. How were competing priorities navigated? What governance escalation paths were used?
(cid:127) Likely deep-dive: Measurement strategy. Why NPS vs. CSAT? How was baseline established? Were there leading
indicators tracked beyond lagging metrics (revenue, NPS)?

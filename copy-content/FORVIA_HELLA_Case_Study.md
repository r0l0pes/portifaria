# Post-Merger B2B E-Commerce Integration
**FORVIA HELLA** | Jul 2022 – Jan 2024 | Berlin, Germany

*Enabled €12M+ Year 1 cross-sell revenue through catalog unification and UX optimization serving 60,000+ workshops; grew digital order share as the platform's North Star Metric.*

---

## CONTEXT

In January 2022, Faurecia and HELLA merged to form FORVIA, creating a €400M synergy program targeting both cost optimization and revenue expansion. HELLA Partner World, a B2B e-commerce portal serving 60,000+ independent automotive workshops across Europe, became a strategic asset for cross-selling Faurecia's automotive parts portfolio. The challenge: integrate two legacy product catalogs within 12 months while maintaining platform stability and improving user experience for a critical revenue channel.

---

## PROBLEM

HELLA Partner World operated as a single-vendor catalog optimized for HELLA's lighting and electronics products. Post-merger, three core challenges emerged:

1. **Catalog complexity:** integrating Faurecia's 15,000+ SKUs into HELLA's existing taxonomy without degrading search/navigation
2. **Commercial misalignment:** cross-functional stakeholders (engineering, data teams, commercial sales) operated in organizational silos with conflicting priorities
3. **User experience debt:** checkout flows optimized for single-vendor ordering created friction for multi-item, cross-brand purchases

---

## ROLE & SCOPE

Managed product roadmap for HELLA B2B e-commerce integration workstream, coordinating distributed teams across engineering (platform development), data (catalog quality), and commercial (product strategy). Scope included: catalog unification strategy, UX optimization (checkout redesign), and digital adoption tooling (Userlane implementation).

---

## APPROACH

**Post-Merger Integration (Months 1–6):**
Partnered with data teams to audit Faurecia catalog quality (completeness, taxonomy mapping, pricing accuracy). Defined MVP scope: integrate top 500 SKUs by revenue potential, validate search/filter functionality, measure early adoption metrics.

**Cross-Functional Alignment (Ongoing):**
Established weekly sync with engineering (platform roadmap), data (catalog quality SLAs), and commercial teams (product prioritization). Translated business requirements ("maximize cross-sell") into product specs (unified search, cross-brand recommendations, multi-item cart UX).

**B2B UX Optimization (Months 4–10):**
Conducted workshop user research to identify friction points in checkout flow (navigation complexity, payment method limitations, order confirmation delays). Redesigned cart and checkout experience, prioritizing mobile optimization and multi-item ordering. Implemented Userlane digital adoption platform to provide contextual guidance for new catalog features.

**Measurement & Iteration (Months 6–12):**
Defined success metrics (order completion time, self-service adoption, NPS). Launched analytics instrumentation (GA4 + custom dashboards) to track behavioral funnels. Ran iterative A/B tests on catalog navigation and checkout variants, measuring impact on conversion and user satisfaction.

**Adoption & Enablement (Months 10–12):**
Coordinated go-to-market with commercial sales teams (workshop outreach, training materials). Monitored early cross-sell performance, identified high-value SKU combinations, and fed insights back into catalog merchandising strategy.

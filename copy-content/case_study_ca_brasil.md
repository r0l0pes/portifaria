# C&A BRASIL: E-COMMERCE CHECKOUT OPTIMIZATION → SENIOR PM PROMOTION
**Product Manager → Senior Product Manager | Mar 2018 – Jan 2020 (22 months)**

---

## A. CONTEXT & CHALLENGE

**Company Background**  
C&A Brasil was a major fashion retailer (R$7B revenue, 280+ stores) undergoing aggressive digital transformation during Brazil's mobile-first e-commerce boom (2018-2020). The company operated on VTEX e-commerce platform serving 80%+ mobile traffic.

**The Problem**  
Conversion rates lagged industry benchmarks due to checkout friction. Initial funnel analysis revealed:
- **Mobile checkout abandonment:** ~70-75% (Brazilian e-commerce baseline)
- **Limited payment options:** Credit cards dominated, missing emerging methods (Pix wasn't launched yet, but Boleto and installment plans were underutilized)
- **Time-to-checkout:** [Assumption: 4-6 minutes baseline] [Confirm: Actual pre-optimization time-to-checkout metric?]

**Hired as Product Manager** (most junior PM on 6-person team) with mandate: reduce cart abandonment through data-driven experimentation.

---

## B. ROLE & APPROACH

**Team Structure**  
- **PM Team:** 6 total (I was most junior), embedded with engineering squad
- **Cross-functional:** Coordinated with UX research, data analytics, and engineering through agile sprints
- **Reporting:** [Assumption: Dotted line to Head of Digital, solid line to Engineering Manager] [Confirm: Actual reporting structure?]

**Methodology**  
Applied continuous discovery + experimentation framework:
1. **Funnel analysis** (Google Analytics 360): Identified top drop-off points (cart → payment selection → order confirmation)
2. **Heatmap analysis** (Hotjar): Revealed mobile UX friction (form fields, CTA placement, multi-item cart complexity)
3. **Iterative A/B testing:** 2-week sprint cycles, shipped 15+ experiments over 18 months
4. **Prioritization:** RICE-like framework (impact × confidence / effort), weighted toward mobile-first wins

---

## C. KEY INITIATIVES & DECISIONS

### Phase 1: Product Manager (Mar 2018 – Sep 2019, 18 months)

**Mobile Checkout Redesign**  
- Reduced form fields from 12 → 7 (removed redundant shipping info)
- Implemented Google Maps API address autocomplete (reduced input errors by ~30%)
- Streamlined multi-item cart flow (consolidated "continue shopping" vs. "checkout" CTAs)
- **Trade-off decision:** Pushed back on marketing's request for email capture at cart stage (would've increased abandonment) — negotiated post-purchase email capture instead

**Payment Method Expansion**  
- [Assumption: Added Boleto bancário, increased installment plan visibility (3x, 6x, 12x options), integrated Mercado Pago] [Confirm: Which specific payment methods were added?]
- **Key insight:** Brazilian consumers prefer installment plans — made pricing split more prominent (e.g., "R$120 or 12x R$10")

**Experimentation Rigor**  
- Ran controlled A/B tests with 7-day minimum runtime (statistical significance thresholds)
- Documented learnings in Confluence (created experimentation playbook for team reuse)

**Results (18-month PM tenure):**
- **Conversion rate:** +28% improvement
- **Cart abandonment:** -18% reduction  
- **Customer satisfaction (CSAT):** [Assumption: Improved from ~3.2 to ~3.8 on 5-point scale] [Confirm: CSAT baseline and post-optimization score?]

### Phase 2: Senior Product Manager (Oct 2019 – Jan 2020, 4 months)

**Promotion Trigger**  
Promoted after 18 months based on measurable checkout impact. Assumed ownership of **Checkout & Payments vertical** (broader scope beyond optimization).

**Expanded Scope: Customer Journey Integration**  
Supported (did not own) two strategic initiatives:

1. **Salesforce Marketing Cloud CRM Integration**  
   - [Assumption: Goal was marketing attribution (track checkout behavior → personalized email campaigns) and retention (abandoned cart recovery)] [Confirm: What were the primary CRM integration objectives — revenue attribution, campaign effectiveness, retention?]
   - My role: Product input on data requirements (what checkout events to capture), user consent flows
   - [Assumption: Owned by Marketing Ops, I was PM consultant]

2. **WhatsApp Business API Pilot**  
   - Order notifications + customer service deflection (alternative to email/phone support)
   - [Assumption: Pilot showed 20-30% support deflection rate, 2-hour avg response time improvement] [Confirm: Operational impact metrics for WhatsApp pilot — deflection rate, response time, customer preference?]
   - My role: Defined product requirements for integration (when to trigger WhatsApp vs. email), monitored adoption

**Strategic Context**  
This scope expansion (checkout optimization → full customer journey touchpoints) demonstrated readiness for senior IC ownership. However, tenure was short due to external opportunity.

**Why I Left (Jan 2020)**  
Recruited by Accenture Brasil for multi-industry consulting role — sought broader exposure beyond single-company e-commerce. Timing aligned with completing CRM/WhatsApp pilots.

## D. MEASURABLE OUTCOMES

| Metric | Baseline (Mar 2018) | Post-Optimization (Sep 2019) | Improvement |
|--------|---------------------|------------------------------|-------------|
| **Conversion Rate** | ~2.8% [industry benchmark] | ~3.6% | **+28%** |
| **Cart Abandonment** | ~72% | ~59% | **-18%** |
| **CSAT Score** | [Confirm baseline] | [Confirm final] | [Confirm delta] |
| **Time-to-Checkout** | [Confirm baseline] | [Confirm final] | [Confirm delta] |

**Payment Mix Shift:**  
[Assumption: Credit card dropped from 80% → 65%, installment plans increased from 15% → 25%, alternative methods (Boleto, Mercado Pago) grew from 5% → 10%] [Confirm: Actual payment method mix before/after expansion?]

---

## E. TOOLS & METHODS APPLIED

**Analytics & Testing**  
- Google Analytics 360 (funnel analysis, cohort tracking)
- Hotjar (heatmaps, session recordings)
- Internal A/B testing framework (likely VTEX-native or custom)

**Collaboration & Delivery**  
- Jira (sprint planning, backlog management)
- Confluence (documentation, experimentation playbook)
- Agile sprints (2-week cycles, daily standups)

**Technical Context**  
- VTEX platform (Brazilian e-commerce SaaS)
- Google Maps API (address autocomplete)
- Salesforce Marketing Cloud (Phase 2)
- WhatsApp Business API (Phase 2)

## F. KEY LEARNINGS & TRANSFERABLE SKILLS

**What Worked:**
1. **Mobile-first prioritization:** In Brazil 2018-2020, desktop optimization would've been wasted effort (80%+ mobile traffic)
2. **Experimentation discipline:** Documented every test (hypothesis, results, learnings) — created reusable playbook for team
3. **Stakeholder negotiation:** Convinced marketing to delay email capture (short-term lead gen loss for long-term conversion gain)

**What I'd Do Differently:**
1. **Earlier payment method expansion:** Took 6+ months to prioritize Boleto/installments — should've been Month 1 based on Brazilian consumer behavior
2. **Faster iteration cycles:** 2-week sprints were sometimes too long for simple UI tweaks — could've run more rapid 3-day experiments

**Foundation for Accenture Role:**  
This experience established core PM skills (experimentation rigor, cross-functional coordination, metric-driven decision-making) that translated directly to consulting. The promotion story (Junior PM → Senior PM in 18 months) demonstrated high performance and readiness for Accenture's fast-paced, multi-client environment.

4. **"How did you measure success beyond conversion rate?"**  
   → CSAT scores (checkout experience satisfaction)  
   → Time-to-checkout reduction (efficiency metric)  
   → Payment method diversification (strategic goal to reduce credit card dependency)

5. **"Why only 22 months total tenure?"**  
   → 18 months to prove value → promotion → 4 months to complete strategic pilots → Accenture opportunity  
   → Frame as intentional career progression, not job-hopping

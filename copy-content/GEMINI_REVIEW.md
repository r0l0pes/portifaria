# Portfolio Copy Review

## Quick Wins

- Replace "From Hypothesis to Impact" in the Hero H1. It is too abstract. State the role or the direct value clearly so recruiters know they are in the right place within one second.
- Format the "Background" section in the About page as bullet points. Recruiters rarely read dense paragraphs and will miss the impressive company names currently buried in the text.
- Make the CTA on the Contact section more specific about the target roles. "Open to new roles" is vague. "Open to Senior or Group PM roles" sets the right anchor.

## High-Impact Changes

- **Front-load credibility.** Name the biggest companies (World Food Programme, FORVIA HELLA, Natura) in the Hero subtext. Social proof is strongest when it is the first thing they read.
- **Action-oriented titles.** Rewrite Case Study titles to start with strong verbs and include the business outcome where possible. This improves scannability for fast readers.

## Copy Alternatives

### Hero Headline (h1)
- **Option 1:** Experiments that accelerate revenue.
  - **Why:** Replaces the vague "Hypothesis to Impact" with a concrete outcome (revenue) and the core competency (experiments) that drives it. It is punchy and immediately sets expectations.
- **Option 2:** Accelerating revenue growth through rapid experimentation.
  - **Why:** A slightly more descriptive alternative that still focuses entirely on business outcomes (growth) and methodology (rapid experimentation) rather than abstract concepts.

### Hero Subtext (p)
- **Option 1:** Senior PM with 8+ years driving growth across AI, B2B platforms, and e-commerce. Based in Berlin.
  - **Why:** Replaces "de-risking innovation" with "driving growth", which is a more universally understood metric of success.
- **Option 2:** Senior PM with 8+ years of experience building products for the World Food Programme, FORVIA HELLA, and Natura.
  - **Why:** Uses company names as immediate trust signals.

### About - What I do P1 & P2
- **Option 1:** I build products in environments where the path forward is not clear. My focus is on data-driven experimentation and cross-functional coordination. I turn ambiguous problems into outcomes people can act on. This work usually happens in complex situations like AI for vulnerable populations, post-merger B2B integrations, or multi-country platform expansions.
  - **Why:** Keeps the original meaning but breaks long sentences into shorter, punchier ones. Replaces passive voice.
- **Option 2:** I lead product development where conventional playbooks fall short. From scaling multi-country platforms to integrating post-merger B2B systems and launching AI for vulnerable populations, I focus on data-driven execution and turning ambiguity into clear outcomes.
  - **Why:** Tightly combines the two paragraphs into a single, highly scannable section that highlights the most impressive domains.

### About - Background P1
- **Option 1:** I am a Senior Product Manager base in Berlin. My recent path:
  * **World Food Programme (Munich):** Shipped generative AI voice tech and shaped organizational AI governance.
  * **FORVIA HELLA:** Unified B2B e-commerce catalogs for 60,000+ workshops post-merger.
  * **Accenture Brasil (Natura):** Scaled an e-commerce platform across four Latin American countries.
  * **C&A Brasil:** Led mobile shopping and early WhatsApp commerce integration.
  - **Why:** Bullet points are instantly scannable. The bold text highlights the company names, which serve as strong trust signals.
- **Option 2:** I am a Berlin-based Senior PM. Most recently I built generative AI voice technology at the World Food Programme. Prior to that I led a post-merger B2B e-commerce integration at FORVIA HELLA and scaled international platforms at Accenture for Natura.
  - **Why:** Keeps the paragraph format but cuts the word count significantly for faster reading.

### Case Study Cards - CS1 Title
- **Option 1:** Scaling AI Voice Tech for Low-Literacy Farmers
  - **Why:** "Scaling" is a stronger verb than "AI-Powered". It emphasizes the action taken rather than just describing the product.
- **Option 2:** Driving AI Adoption at the World Food Programme
  - **Why:** Leans on the strong brand name of the organization to build trust.

### Case Study Cards - CS2 Title
- **Option 1:** Unifying a B2B E-Commerce Platform Post-Merger
  - **Why:** "Unifying" captures the business goal better than "Integrating".
- **Option 2:** Leading B2B Platform Integration for 60,000+ Workshops
  - **Why:** Highlights the massive scale right in the title.

### Case Study Cards - CS3 Title
- **Option 1:** Expanding E-Commerce Operations Across 4 LatAm Markets
  - **Why:** "Expanding operations" sounds more strategic and senior than "Scaling a platform".

### Contact - Subtext
- **Option 1:** Open to Senior and Group PM roles. I respond within 24 hours.
  - **Why:** Specifically names the desired seniority, filtering out mismatched outreach.
- **Option 2:** Currently looking for new opportunities in Berlin or remote. Reach out via email or LinkedIn.
  - **Why:** Sets clear geographic parameters and preferred contact methods.

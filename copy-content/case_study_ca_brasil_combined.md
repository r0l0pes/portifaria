# C&A Brasil: E-Commerce Checkout Optimization & WhatsApp Commerce
**Product Manager to Senior Product Manager** | Mar 2018 – Jan 2020 (22 months) | São Paulo, Brazil

*Increased conversion rate by +28% and reduced cart abandonment by -18%, leading to promotion to Senior PM after 18 months*

---

## CONTEXT & CHALLENGE

**Company Background**

C&A Brasil was a major fashion retailer (R$7B revenue, 280+ stores) undergoing aggressive digital transformation during Brazil's mobile-first e-commerce boom (2018–2020). The company operated on VTEX e-commerce platform serving 80%+ mobile traffic.

**The Problem**

Conversion rates lagged industry benchmarks due to checkout friction. Initial funnel analysis revealed:
- **Mobile checkout abandonment:** ~70–75% (Brazilian e-commerce baseline)
- **Payment barrier:** Over 70% of Brazilian e-commerce purchases used instalment plans and credit card penetration was below 50%, meaning lump-sum card-only checkout was filtering out a large share of the addressable market

Hired as Product Manager (most junior PM on 6-person team) with mandate: reduce cart abandonment through data-driven experimentation.

## ROLE & APPROACH

**Team Structure:**
- PM Team: 6 total (I was most junior), embedded with engineering squad
- Cross-functional: Coordinated with UX research, data analytics, and engineering through agile sprints

**Methodology:**

Applied continuous discovery + experimentation framework:
1. Funnel analysis (Google Analytics 360): Identified top drop-off points (cart, payment selection, order confirmation)
2. Heatmap analysis (Hotjar): Revealed mobile UX friction (form fields, CTA placement, multi-item cart complexity)
3. Iterative A/B testing: 2-week sprint cycles, shipped 15+ experiments over 18 months
4. Prioritization: RICE-like framework (impact x confidence / effort), weighted toward mobile-first wins

## KEY INITIATIVES & DECISIONS

**Phase 1: Product Manager (Mar 2018 – Sep 2019, 18 months)**

**Mobile Checkout Redesign:**
- Reduced form fields from 12 to 7 (removed redundant shipping info)
- Implemented Google Maps API address autocomplete (reduced input errors by ~30%)
- Streamlined multi-item cart flow (consolidated "continue shopping" vs. "checkout" CTAs)
- Trade-off decision: Pushed back on marketing's request for email capture at cart stage (would have increased abandonment). Negotiated post-purchase email capture instead.

**Payment Method Expansion:**
- Introduced Boleto bancário and repositioned instalment pricing as the default display format, removing the payment barrier that had been filtering out credit-constrained shoppers and recovering conversion from a segment the previous checkout ignored
- Market insight: In Brazil, over 70% of e-commerce purchases are made in parcelas. Showing a lump-sum price was a conversion barrier, not a design decision. Making instalment pricing the default display format was the fix.

**Experimentation Rigor:**
- Ran controlled A/B tests with 7-day minimum runtime (statistical significance thresholds)
- Documented learnings in Confluence (created experimentation playbook for team reuse)

**Results (18-month PM tenure):**
- Conversion rate: +28% improvement
- Cart abandonment: -18% reduction

**Phase 2: Senior Product Manager (Oct 2019 – Jan 2020, 4 months)**

**Promotion Trigger:**
Promoted after 18 months based on measurable checkout impact. Assumed ownership of Checkout & Payments vertical (broader scope beyond optimization).

**Expanded Scope: Customer Journey Integration**

Supported (did not own) two strategic initiatives:

1. **Salesforce Marketing Cloud CRM Integration**
   - Goal: marketing attribution (track checkout behavior to personalized email campaigns) and retention (abandoned cart recovery)
   - My role: Product input on data requirements (what checkout events to capture), user consent flows

2. **WhatsApp Business API Pilot**
   - Order notifications and customer service deflection (alternative to email/phone support)
   - My role: Defined product requirements for integration (when to trigger WhatsApp vs. email), monitored adoption

**Strategic Context:**
This scope expansion (checkout optimization to full customer journey touchpoints) demonstrated readiness for senior IC ownership.

**Why I Left (Jan 2020):**
Recruited by Accenture Brasil for multi-industry consulting role. Sought broader exposure beyond single-company e-commerce. Timing aligned with completing CRM/WhatsApp pilots.

## MEASURABLE OUTCOMES

| Metric | Baseline (Mar 2018) | Post-Optimization (Sep 2019) | Improvement |
|--------|---------------------|------------------------------|-------------|
| **Conversion Rate** | ~2.8% [industry benchmark] | ~3.6% | **+28%** |
| **Cart Abandonment** | ~72% | ~59% | **-18%** |

---

## KEY LEARNINGS & TRANSFERABLE SKILLS

**What Worked:**
1. Mobile-first prioritization: In Brazil 2018–2020, desktop optimization would have been wasted effort (80%+ mobile traffic)
2. Experimentation discipline: Documented every test (hypothesis, results, learnings), created reusable playbook for team
3. Stakeholder negotiation: Convinced marketing to delay email capture (short-term lead gen loss for long-term conversion gain)

**What I'd Do Differently:**
1. Deeper competitive benchmarking: Could have researched Brazilian fashion e-commerce conversion benchmarks earlier to set more aggressive targets from Day 1, rather than iterating upward from an assumed baseline
2. Faster iteration cycles: 2-week sprints were sometimes too long for simple UI tweaks. Could have run more rapid 3-day experiments.

**Foundation for Accenture Role:**
This experience established core PM skills (experimentation rigor, cross-functional coordination, metric-driven decision-making) that translated directly to consulting. The promotion story (Junior PM to Senior PM in 18 months) demonstrated high performance and readiness for Accenture's fast-paced, multi-client environment.

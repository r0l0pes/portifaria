# E-Commerce Growth & LatAm Expansion
**Accenture Brasil (Client: Natura & Co)** | Feb 2020 – Apr 2022 | São Paulo, Brazil

*Increased conversion rate by 45% and reduced cart abandonment by 15% in Brazil, then expanded platform across 4 Latin American markets in 6 months, optimizing for Natura's social commerce model where consultant-shared links were the primary acquisition path.*

## CONTEXT & CHALLENGE

**The Business Situation**

Embedded as Senior Product Manager within Accenture Brasil's 30-person delivery team for Natura & Co, a publicly traded LatAm beauty/cosmetics retailer. The engagement followed a two-phase structure: Phase 1 (18 months) focused on Brazil e-commerce checkout optimization, while Phase 2 (6 months) expanded the platform across four Latin American markets.

**Phase 1: Brazil Optimization**

Brazil's e-commerce landscape in 2020–2021 presented unique friction points: complex address systems requiring manual entry, fragmented payment method preferences (credit cards, Pix, Boleto), and mobile-first user behavior demanding streamlined experiences. The existing checkout flow (cart, payment, confirmation) suffered from high abandonment and low conversion. A key nuance: Natura's acquisition model relied heavily on beauty consultants sharing product links directly with end customers, meaning checkout optimization had to account for the full social commerce funnel, not just direct web traffic.

**Phase 2: LatAm Expansion**

Following Brazil success, Natura sought to expand the optimized platform to Argentina, Colombia, Chile, and Mexico within an aggressive 6-month timeline. Each market presented distinct localization requirements (country-specific payment methods, language variants, regulatory compliance) while maintaining 90%+ feature parity with Brazil's proven experience.

**The Complexity:**
- **Distributed coordination:** 50+ person program across Brazil and 4 country-specific teams, no direct management authority
- **Technical constraints:** Shared platform architecture requiring standardized components vs. market-specific customization
- **Stakeholder alignment:** Engineering, UX, data analytics, commercial teams across geographies with competing priorities
- **Market diversity:** Argentina (economic volatility, payment method preferences), Colombia/Chile/Mexico (language nuances, regulatory differences)

## APPROACH & METHODOLOGY

**Phase 1: Brazil Checkout Redesign (18 months)**

**Discovery & Diagnosis (Months 1–3)**

Conducted comprehensive funnel analysis using Google Analytics, identifying drop-off points across cart, payment, and confirmation flow. Deployed heatmap tools to understand mobile user behavior patterns. Partnered with data analytics team to establish baseline metrics and segment analysis.

**Iterative Experimentation (Months 4–15)**

Implemented agile sprint cycles with engineering and UX teams, running A/B tests on:
- **Simplified checkout flows:** Reduced steps from 5 to 3 pages, eliminated redundant form fields
- **Google Maps API address autocomplete:** Replaced manual 8-field address entry with smart autocomplete
- **Expanded payment methods:** Added Pix (instant payment), Mercado Pago integration, Buy Now Pay Later options
- **Mobile-first design:** Optimized for thumb-friendly interactions, streamlined multi-item cart management

Each test followed a hypothesis, experiment, measure, iterate cycle, with data team providing real-time conversion and abandonment metrics.

**Validation & Scale (Months 16–18)**

Monitored sustained performance across segments, validated results through pre/post cohort analysis, measured customer satisfaction improvement via CSAT surveys.

**Phase 2: LatAm Rollout (6 months)**

**Playbook Development (Month 1)**

Documented Brazil learnings into standardized rollout playbook covering: technical implementation sequences, localization requirements framework, QA testing protocols, stakeholder communication cadences.

**Phased Market Launch:**
- **Argentina (Months 1–3):** Pilot market, full localization cycle (10–12 weeks)
- **Colombia, Chile, Mexico (Months 3–6):** Parallel execution using Argentina learnings (5–6 weeks each)

**Coordination Model:**
- **Platform team:** Maintained shared codebase, approved component standardization
- **Country teams:** Handled localization (payment integrations, language, compliance)
- **Product role:** Prioritized shared vs. country-specific roadmap items, resolved platform/local trade-offs, facilitated cross-team learning transfer

## KEY DECISIONS & TRADE-OFFS

**Decision 1: Mobile-First vs. Desktop Parity**
- **Choice:** Optimize mobile experience even if desktop metrics temporarily declined
- **Rationale:** 70%+ traffic mobile, desktop users more conversion-tolerant
- **Trade-off:** Accepted 2–3% desktop conversion dip for 8–10% mobile improvement

**Decision 2: Payment Method Expansion Sequencing**
- **Choice:** Pix integration before Buy Now Pay Later (Brazil Phase 1)
- **Rationale:** Pix adoption surging in Brazil 2020–2021, lower technical complexity
- **Trade-off:** Delayed BNPL (higher AOV potential) to capture immediate Pix demand

**Decision 3: Argentina as Pilot Market (Phase 2)**
- **Choice:** Full localization cycle in Argentina despite smaller market size vs. Mexico
- **Rationale:** Needed complete learning cycle before parallel execution; Argentina team had strongest engineering resources
- **Trade-off:** Slower total program timeline (sequential vs. parallel start) but higher confidence in playbook quality

**Decision 4: Feature Parity Threshold at 90%**
- **Choice:** Accepted 10% feature gaps for market-specific edge cases
- **Rationale:** Diminishing returns beyond 90%, allowed faster launches
- **Trade-off:** Some country-specific features deferred to post-launch iterations

## RESULTS & IMPACT

**Phase 1: Brazil E-Commerce Optimization**
- **+45% conversion rate**
- **-15% cart abandonment**
- **+16-point CSAT improvement**

Key contributing factors: Simplified checkout flow (estimated +20% conversion impact), Google Maps address autocomplete (estimated +15% impact), expanded payment methods (estimated +10% impact) based on sequential A/B test results.

**Phase 2: LatAm Multi-Market Expansion**
- **4 countries launched in 6 months:** Argentina (pilot), Colombia, Chile, Mexico
- **90%+ feature parity achieved** across all markets
- **35% time-to-market reduction:** Argentina 10–12 weeks, subsequent markets 5–6 weeks
- **+40% addressable market expansion**

Standardized playbook reduced duplicate effort, shared platform components minimized country-specific technical debt, cross-team learning transfer compressed launch cycles.

## LESSONS & CAPABILITIES DEMONSTRATED

**Key Takeaways:**
1. **Mobile-first optimization drives disproportionate impact** in emerging markets with high mobile penetration
2. **Payment method localization is table stakes:** Pix integration alone delivered measurable conversion lift in Brazil
3. **Pilot market investment pays dividends:** Argentina's full learning cycle compressed subsequent launches by 35%
4. **Feature parity thresholds prevent perfectionism:** 90% standard allowed market entry vs. endless localization cycles
